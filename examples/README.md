## Overview
The following examples demonstrate how to use the features provided by the tree in practice -

* Number of distinct elements in array (```array_distinct.cpp```)- You are given an array, and must count the number of distinct values in the array without modifying or sorting it. Additionally, you must also print the elements to the console.

* Lumberjack (```lumberjack.cpp```)- As a lumberjack, you have certain Logs of wood, each having a size and a unique ID, which you would like to sell. You recieve requests from people to purchase these logs, with each request having a minimum size requirement. For each request, you must report the smallest log which satisfies the size requirement of the request (or report if there are no satisfactory logs available). Each log can only be sold once, i.e. reporting the same log for more than one request is not allowed.

* Trains (```trains.cpp```)- **This is an interactive example.** As the manager of a prominent railway station, it is your job to keep track of, update and report all trains (each having a unique ID, a name and a pickup time) which pass through your station. You must be able to perform the following operations-
    * Add a new train to the list
    * Remove an old train from the list
    * Report all the trains passing through your station
    * Given an interval, report all trains whose pickup time lies in the given time interval

* Full demonstration (```demo_all.cpp```)- This example demonstrates all the features provided by the tree.
